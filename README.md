# Research Paper Intelligence Platform

> An academic paper analysis system that leverages learned hybrid dense-sparse retrieval with domain-aware explanation generation to create sophisticated, audience-adaptive summaries of scientific literature.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Traditional academic paper analysis systems rely on basic embedding-based retrieval and generic summarization approaches. This project attempts to push for:
