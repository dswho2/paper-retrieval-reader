# Research Paper Intelligence Platform

> An academic paper analysis system that leverages learned hybrid dense-sparse retrieval with domain-aware explanation generation to create sophisticated, audience-adaptive summaries of scientific literature.

## Project Vision

Traditional academic paper analysis systems rely on basic embedding-based retrieval and generic summarization approaches. This project attempts to push for:

1. **Learned Hybrid Retrieval**: Combining domain-adapted dense encodings with learned sparse representations via neural fusion networks
2. **Domain-Aware Intelligence**: Scientific field classification and audience-adaptive explanation generation
3. **Future Multi-Modal Enhancement**: Extensible architecture for processing figures, equations, and tables

The core innovation focuses on hybrid retrieval that significantly outperforms traditional RAG systems, with domain-aware explanations that adapt to user expertise levels. The architecture is designed to scale from single-paper analysis to automated weekly processing of new research publications.

## Model Selection and Decisions

### Dense Retrieval Model Choice: allenai-specter

**Why allenai-specter over SciBERT:**

**Purpose-Built for Paper Similarity**
- Trained specifically on scientific paper abstracts and citation relationships
- Optimized for paper-to-paper similarity tasks
- Already available as sentence-transformers model (no fine-tuning)

**Practical Advantages**
- **Immediate Use**: No fine-tuning required to get good results
- **Citation-Aware**: Understands semantic relationships between papers
- **Proven Performance**: Widely adopted in academic paper retrieval systems
- **Resource Efficient**: 110M parameters, manageable for personal projects

**Alternative Models Considered:**

**SciBERT** (`allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased`)
- **Pros**: General scientific language understanding, flexible for multiple NLP tasks
- **Cons**: Would require fine-tuning for retrieval tasks, more setup work
- **When to Use**: If you need general scientific text understanding beyond paper similarity

**sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2**
- **Pros**: Excellent general-purpose model, great performance/size ratio
- **Cons**: Not domain-specific for scientific content
- **When to Use**: For general document retrieval outside scientific domain

**microsoft/specter2**
- **Pros**: Latest scientific paper embedding model, improvements over original SPECTER
- **Cons**: Newer model with less proven adoption, potentially more complex setup
- **Future Consideration**: Could be evaluated as an upgrade path
